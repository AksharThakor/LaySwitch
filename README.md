# LaySwitch
Made for Adaptive UI Layouts, LaySwitch is a complete end-to-end system that detects whether a smartphone is being used with the left, right, or both hands, using only IMU sensor data. It provides a fully implemented data-collection app, a DL training pipeline, and a real-time on-device inference app powered by TensorFlow Lite.
